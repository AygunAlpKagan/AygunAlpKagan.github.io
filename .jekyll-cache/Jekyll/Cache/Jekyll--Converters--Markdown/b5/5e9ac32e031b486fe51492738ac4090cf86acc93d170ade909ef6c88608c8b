<p><strong>Web scraping is the process of using bots to extract content and data from a website.</strong>
Unlike screen scraping, which only copies pixels displayed onscreen, web scraping extracts underlying HTML code and, with it, data stored in a database. The scraper can then replicate entire website content elsewhere.</p>

<p>Web scraping is used in a variety of digital businesses that rely on data harvesting. Legitimate use cases include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Search engine bots crawling a site, analyzing its content and then ranking it.</li>
  <li>Price comparison sites deploying bots to auto-fetch prices and product descriptions for allied seller websites.</li>
  <li>Market research companies using scrapers to pull data from forums and social media (e.g., for sentiment analysis).</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="web-scraping-using-axios-and-cheerio">Web Scraping using axios and Cheerio</h2>

<p>There are two really great tools to use when scraping websites with NodeJs: Axios and Cheerio. Using these two tools together, we can grab the HTML of a web page, load it into Cheerio (more on this later), and query the elements for the information we need.</p>

<p><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dbh0tmmir/image/upload/v1660651864/1_j_P_Zd_F7_OOID_3j_LY_Pb_MT_9f_Cg_c97a536f8e.png" alt="1_jPZdF7OOID3jLYPbMT9fCg.png" /></p>

<h3 id="axios">Axios</h3>

<p>Axios is a promise based HTTP client for both the browser, and for NodeJS. This is a well known package that is used in tons and tons of projects. Most of the React and Ember projects I work on use Axios to make API calls.</p>

<p>We can use axios to get the HTML of a website:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>
  import axios from 'axios';

  await axios.get('https://www.realtor.com/news/real-estate-news/');

</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="cheerio">Cheerio</h3>

<p>Cheerio is the most amazing package I never heard of until now. Essentially, Cheerio gives you jQuery-like queries on the DOM structure of the HTML you load! Its amazing and allows you to do things like this:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>  const cheerio = require('cheerio')
  const $ = cheerio.load('&lt;h2 class="title"&gt;Hello world&lt;/h2&gt;')
  const titleText = $('h2.title').text();

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>With Axios and Cheerio, making our NodeJS scraper is dead simple. We call a URL with axios, and load the output HTML into cheerio. Once our HTML is loaded into cheerio, we can query the DOM for whatever information we want!</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>import axios from 'axios';
import cheerio from 'cheerio';

export async function scrapeRealtor() {
  const html = await axios.get('https://www.realtor.com/news/real-estate-news/');
  const $ = await cheerio.load(html.data);
  let data = [];

  $('.site-main article').each((i, elem) =&gt; {
    if (i &lt;= 3) {
      data.push({
        image: $(elem).find('img.wp-post-image').attr('src'),
        title: $(elem).find('h2.entry-title').text(),
        excerpt: $(elem).find('p.hide_xxs').text().trim(),
        link: $(elem).find('h2.entry-title a').attr('href')
      })
    }
  });

  console.log(data);
}
</code></pre></div></div>
